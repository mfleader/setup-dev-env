If you frequently switch between different Java versions, it is a good idea to write a short script to automate the process. Here is the script I used for switching to OpenJDK 8 on my machine.

java8.sh

sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME

Similarly, you can create scripts for other Java versions installed on your machine. The next step is to add these scripts as aliases to .bashrc file.

# Java Alias
alias java8='source /opt/java/switch/java8.sh'
alias java11='source /opt/java/switch/java11.sh'

Next, run the following command to load the changes of .bashrc file:

$ source ~/.bashrc

Now if you want to switch to Java 8, just type the following command in your terminal:

$ java8
